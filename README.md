## Searching Cities

<br />
**Prerequisities**

* The project was built on Android Studio v1.3.2
* Android API 22 or higher
* If run the project on an emulator, you should have the [Google Play Services](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/overview) apk installed on it
* Please check the following [guide](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/location/strategies.html#MockData) to simulate a GPS location on your emulated device
 

Use the Android application **SearchCities** in the `app/` folder to browse your index.

Import the project in Android Studio, then hit *Run*.

When launched for the first time, the application will prompt you for GPS geolocation permission.

Tap *Allow* to enable the geosearch features from Algolia services.<br />
If GPS permission is denied, the application will only use regular search for browsing cities by their names.
